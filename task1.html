            Player pianos are pianos that can play automatically when loaded with a specially formatted ream of paper.
            These rolls of paper
            have holes in them, so that as they scroll past the hammers the piano plays the notes. Most models have a
            variety of levers and
            switches in order to control dynamics, speed, and articulation. They were fairly popular in the early 20th
            century, and lost
            mainstream popularity once phonograph technology developed further. In their day, they actually caused some
            controversy a
            mong companies that published sheet music, for threatening business and de-emphasizing the need for actual
            piano-playing skills
